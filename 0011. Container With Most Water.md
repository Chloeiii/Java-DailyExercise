#### Container With Most Water
https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:


    Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    Output: 49
    Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

    Input: height = [1,1]
    Output: 1
Example 3:

    Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
    Output: 16
Example 4:

    Input: height = [1,2,1]
    Output: 2
 

Constraints:

    n == height.length
    2 <= n <= 105
    0 <= height[i] <= 104

    class Solution {
        public int maxArea(int[] height) {
            int maxWater = 0;
            int columns = height.length;
            //base cases 
            if (columns == 2){
                return Math.min(height[0], height[1]);
            }

            int left = 0;
            int right = columns - 1;
            while (left < right){
                int Water = Math.min(height[left], height[right])*(right-left);
                maxWater = Math.max(maxWater, Water);

                if(height[left] > height[right]){
                    right --;
                }else{
                    left ++;
                }

            }
            return maxWater;
        }
    }
