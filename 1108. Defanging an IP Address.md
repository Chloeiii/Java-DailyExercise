## Defanging an IP Address
https://leetcode.com/problems/defanging-an-ip-address/

Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

 
Example 1:

    Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
    Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
Example 2:

    Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
    Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
     

Constraints:

    The given address is a valid IPv4 address.

    class Solution {
        public String defangIPaddr(String address) {
            String result = "";
            for(int i=0; i<address.length(); i++){
                if (address.charAt(i) == '.'){
                    result += "[.]";
                }else{
                    result += address.charAt(i);
                }
            }
            return result;
        }
    }
