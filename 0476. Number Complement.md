## 476. Number Complement
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/


Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

  **Note:**
  1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
  2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
  
  **Example 1:**
  
    Input: 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
  
  **Example 2:**
  
    Input: 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

    public int findComplement(int num) {
          int result=0;
          int index=0;
          while(num!=0){
              //get last digit and flip
              int flipLastDigit = 1-num%2;
              //put it at the right place
              result+=flipLastDigit*Math.pow(2,index);
              num=num>>1;
              index++;
          }
          return result;
         
      }
