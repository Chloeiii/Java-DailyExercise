## 137. Single Number II

https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/

Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

    Input: [2,2,3,2]
    Output: 3

**Example 2:**

    Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
    Output: 99
